<h3>Audio Recording</h3>
<p>When recording audio from a microphone, make sure to <b>wear headphones</b> so audio from FL Studio Mobile isn't mixed in with the recorded source. <b>To set up for recording:</b>
<ol>
<li>Check the <b><a href="FL%20Studio%20Mobile_HomePanel.htm#audio">SETTINGS > Audio ></a></b> section for the correct Audio Input. This is usually set to Microphone (or 'Recording Source Stereo'). You only need change this control if you have more than one Microphone on your device, you are using a <b>USB audio interface</b> or there is no audio being recorded. <b>NOTE:</b> In the case of Audio interfaces, you may need to test input options to find the correct one for your microphone or instrument (e.g. guitar) input you are using. <b>Windows App</b> users, see the NOTES at the bottom of this section.
<p class="justImages">
<img src="../img_plug/flmobile_playlist_audiorecording_input.png" width="500">
<li>Tap the 'Add Track' icon and select '<b>Audio Record</b>'.
<p class="justImages">
<img src="../img_plug/flmobile_playlist_audiorecording.png" width="700">
<li><a href="FL%20Studio%20Mobile_HomePanel.htm#latency_compensation">Calibrate the device</a> (optional) - This is normally done once and remembered. Some devices will need to perform a calibration each time the App is restarted. The purpose is to accurately align recorded audio with the Playlist.
<li>Optionally open the Channel Rack to access the <b>monitor control</b>. Tap the microphone icon to mute/activate the live audio monitoring. When recording this should normally be <b>OFF:</b> The input is recorded but not audible through FL Studio Mobile while this is happening. When this is set to <b>ON:</b> The input is recorded and is also audible through FL Studio Mobile. This WILL cause a feedback-loop (squealing and screeching) if you select this option without headphones on.
<p><img src="../img_plug/flmobile_playlist_audiorecording_track.png" width="600">
<li>Tap the 'Record' button and start recording.
</ol>
<p><b>NOTES:</b> On the <a href="FL%20Studio%20Mobile_HomePanel.htm#settings">SETTINGS</a> tab, there are options including '<b>Audio Input</b>', '<b>Enable count-in when recording</b>', '<b>Metronome level</b>' and '<b>Use 32 Bit format when rendering and recording audio</b>' that may be useful to you. Additionally '<b>Sound mode: FAST</b>' may improve the recording experience on some systems.
<p>For <b>Windows devices</b> you will need to set your <b>Settings > Sound > Input</b> to match any custom Audio Interface you are using, for it to be visible in FL Studio Mobile.
<h4>iOS Inter App Audio (IAA) and Audiobus</h4>
