## Overview

FL Studio Mobile is designed to work on any screen from the size of a phone to TV sized touch-monitors. Each FL Studio Mobile 3 Playlist track has an associated 'Rack'. This can contain any number of instrument AND effects plugins. The only limit is your CPU power. There are now also automation-clip style tracks that can be edited just as you can now in FL Studio for the desktop.
