4.  FL Studio Mobile plugin will automatically sync to the Playlist in FL Studio. The tempo is also slaved to FL Studio's host tempo.
5.  Add an empty pattern at least equal-to the length of your Mobile project and press Play in FL Studio (desktop).
6.  From this point on, you can add other plugins and use FL Studio with FL Studio Mobile providing the core of the project.
7.  If needed you can route each Track in FL Studio Mobile to its own Mixer Track in FL Studio. See [FL Studio Plugin Version Routing][4].
8.  Optionally you can use the FL Studio Mobile per-track [Save as MIDI][5] OR complete project [Save to MIDI][6] features to export MIDI data out of FL Studio Mobile and load these in FL Studio.

#### Philosophy of use

Think of the FL Studio Mobile project as the core of the track. [SHARE][3] the `.flm` project between your desktop computer and your mobile device, adding and developing the project. When working inside the desktop version you can take advantage of the greater CPU to enhance it with the highest quality instrument and effect plugins in use by professionals. Alternatively you can make far more complex projects than your mobile device can handle. When transferring the project back, you can mute tracks to keep the CPU use under control.
